For this project, I downloaded Spotify data and created a table, Spotify Data .csv, to insert the data into.
I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

I explored the data by asking questions and using SQL to answer them.

--What is the average danceability by artist and track?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name
ORDER BY avg_danceability DESC;

--Who are the top 10 artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, AVG(popularity) AS avg_popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

--What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(danceability) AS avg_danceability
FROM (
    SELECT danceability
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    ORDER BY popularity DESC
    LIMIT 10
) AS top_10_songs;

--Which song has the highest energy?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY energy DESC
LIMIT 1;

--What is the average loudness of songs grouped by key?
SELECT song_key, AVG(loudness) AS avg_loudness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY song_key
ORDER BY avg_loudness DESC;

--Which artist has the most songs in the dataset?
SELECT artist_name, COUNT(track_name) AS song_count
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY song_count DESC
LIMIT 1;

--What is the average tempo of the songs that have the highest valence (happiest songs)?
SELECT AVG(tempo) AS avg_tempo
FROM (
    SELECT tempo
    FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
    ORDER BY valence DESC
    LIMIT 10
) AS top_valence_songs;
